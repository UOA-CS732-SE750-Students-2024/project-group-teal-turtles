# Intelligent Eats

Are you tired of staring into your fridge, wondering what to cook for dinner?

Do you find yourself stuck in a culinary rut, repeating the same meals week after week? 

Well, worry no more! 

Introducing Intelligent-Eats, the revolutionary ***AI-generated*** meal service designed for you. 

Whether you're craving comfort food classics, exotic international flavors, or healthy, plant-based options, our AI algorithm has you covered.

### Usage

Using Intelligent Eats is as simple as follows:

1. Create an account
2. Follow the onboarding process to add ingredients and favourite meals
3. On the Dashboard, select Basic generation
4. Enter any additional requirements for your meal
5. Click generate and have your generated meal served directly to you

You can share any generated meals with your friends and family via email by clicking the `Share` button at the bottom of the recipe

If you liked your generated meal, you can add it to your favourites by clicking the `Add to favourites` button, also at the bottom of the recipe.

Alternatively, adding or removing favourite meals is done on the profile page, accessed on the top left of the website. Here you can add any of the last 10 meals you generated or revisit them by clicking on them.

Adding or removing disliked ingredients is also done on the profile page. These ingredients will be avoided when generating meals and recipes.

## Running the project

### Prerequisites

Get Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)

This project requires Node.js 20.12.2 or higher

### Running the Frontend

0. Set up the `.env` file in the root directory. See `.env.local.example` for an example

1. Navigate inside the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Then either run it in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or in production mode:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will start the frontend server at http://localhost:3000

### Running the Backend

0. Set up the `.env` file in the root directory. See `.env.example` for an example

1. Navigate inside the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server at http://localhost:3000

## Testing

### Testing the Backend

The backend can be tested by

```bash
cd backend
npm run test
```

### Testing the Frontend

#### Jest

We unit tested our frontend logic with Jest

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```

#### Playwright

End-to-end testing is achieved through playwright

We've focused our tests on some common user flows

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npx playwright install
npx playwright test
```
